				<summary>Caveats</summary>
				The simulator is fairly complete and implements nearly all relevant game mechanics, with the following exceptions:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Pseudo-random skills based on the location of other umas use a best-effort estimation for the distribution of their activation locations which may not be perfectly reflective of in-game behavior in all circumstances</summary>
							<p>Skills that have conditions that require you to be blocked, are based on other umas in your proximity, etc, are modeled according to statistical distributions intended to simulate their in-game behavior but may not be perfectly accurate. It should always find the correct minimum and maximum but the reported mean and median should sometimes be taken with a grain of salt. For example skills with blocked conditions are generally better in races with more umas and worse with fewer. Use your better judgement.</p>
							<p>Skills with conditions with <code>_random</code> in the name (e.g. <code>phase_random</code>, <code>corner_random</code>, <code>straight_random</code>) are implemented identically to the in-game logic and will have more accurate mean/median values, as are skills based purely on the course geometry with no blocked front/side/surrounded conditions.</p>
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Course data is based on the first anniversary patch</summary>
							This is unfortunate but they changed the format that hills were stored in significantly and the simulator can't use the old format. Most of the courses should be unchanged but it's possible there are some slight divergences.
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Downhill speed-up mode is not implemented</summary>
							Relevant for stamina calculation since downhills save you a pretty good amount of HP on average. Consider the reported HP consumption to be worst-case currently. Minimal if any effect on skill efficacy.
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>The <span style="color:rgb(255,119,61);font-weight:bold">Rushed</span> status effect is not implemented</summary>
							Like hills this primarily only impacts HP consumption.
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Skill cooldowns are not implemented</summary>
							Skills only ever activate once even if they have a cooldown like Professor of Curvature or Beeline Burst.
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Unique skill scaling with levels is not implemented</summary>
							Unique skills are always simulated as a base level 3★ unique.
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Speed up mode on Front Runners is not implemented</summary>
							Front Runners have a chance to temporarily speed up based on their wit stat. This is difficult to model and not useful for skill comparisons so it is not implemented, but consider that wit on Front Runners is very slightly more useful than the simulator reports.
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>Motivation is always assumed to be maximum</li>
				</ul>
				By and large it should be highly accurate. It has been battle-tested on the JP server for several years.
